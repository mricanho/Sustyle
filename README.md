### Setup

To run this project locally, please ensure you have Ruby and Ruby on Rails installed on your machine, then clone this repository by running.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mricanho/Sustyle.git
```
Open your terminal and CD to the directory where you create the clone repository.

Now run:

```bash
bundle install
```
The next two steps are important to avoid an error of action text. 

First run:

```bash
yarn install --check-files
```
Then you need to reinstall action text with:

```bash
rails action_text:install 
```
If the install asks you to overwrite something, just enter:

```bash
n
```
To setup the database run:

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```
Is super important to populate the app, so now run:
```bash
rails db:seed
```
To set up the server put:
```bash
rails s
```
After this you can open your favorite web-browser and copy paste the next:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
